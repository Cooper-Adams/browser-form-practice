# browser-form-practice

The purpose of this repository is to gain a bit of extra practice with form validation.

With the use of onfocus() and onblur() I have allowed the webpage to verify the user's previous inputs and give a visual indicator (highlighting the input in red) if their input was invalid.

The input validation is handled by using regex searches to ensure the proper amount and type of data is being submitted.

When the form is "submitted", it is hidden and a message is displayed to the user.

I will likely return to this when I learn how to handle server side submission of forms. PHP required?
